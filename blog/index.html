                    I loved Lego as a kid, and I still like building things. I believe a blank sheet of paper is a challenge to be accepted.
                    I enjoy confronting a software-design problem: working out a solution and implementing it. Presented
                    with the big picture, I try to find a way to make my work fit in harmoniously. I like to write code.
                    Getting the details right matters. I’m not dogmatic: Building something that works as needed is more
                    important than a specific technology or tool. It’s been more than ten years, and I still enjoy building
                    with code.

            <h1>Should the Web be your mobile solution?</h1>
            <time>February 6, 2019</time>
            <p>
                Your product team wants a mobile solution that supports all the platforms. Your technical team provided an estimate that’s expensive and, more importantly, takes too long. Sound familiar?
            </p>
            <p>
                Many organizations have a need for one or more mobile applications; these applications might be used by customers or internally as part of a sales tool or manufacturing process. Of course, creating any software application incurs costs, and choosing a native application as the solution will multiply those costs (a native application is an “app” that can only be used on a single platform like Apple's iOS or Google's Android). A mobile solution that relies on native applications means creating a separate application for each platform with very little overlap between them in terms of time and money spent on development and ongoing maintenance.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is another mobile solution. A Progressive Web App could meet all your needs and wouldn’t require a separate application for each platform.
            </p>
            <p>
                A Progressive Web App (PWA) runs in a Web browser, it's a Website with some extra capabilities that allow it to achieve near-native application functionality. If you think about it, most activities done on a mobile device involve viewing information -- maybe an application that displays information about the weather -- or collecting information through text fields, like ordering coffee for pickup. These interactions are easily accomplished using a PWA. And if your designers want want fancy effects, Web browsers have had mechanisms for adding animations and other visual "sizzle" for a long time.
            </p>
            <p>
                It's also easy to engage your customers. When it comes to native apps, a lot of businesses are discovering that people have become wary of installing new apps on their phones and tablets; they may have concerns about privacy or don't want to give up storage space for another app. A native app almost always has to be installed by an out-of-band process through the platform's app store. PWAs take advantage of the Web’s existing strengths, and your audience finds your application through a link, perhaps from your home page or by using well-known online search tools like DuckDuckGo or Google. Simply navigating to the result downloads and "installs" the application.
            </p>
            <p>
                Existing browser features allow PWAs to be closely integrated into mobile devices. Once the PWA is on a mobile device, it can be used without a network connection (of course, if your application needs to exchange data over the network, this will be a problem, but native apps will suffer this as well). A PWA can interact with the phone or tablet even when the browser isn’t open: the PWA can display push notifications or update data from a remote server. It can also store user preferences and data and resume a workflow that has been interrupted.
            </p>
            <p>
                You may not realize it, but several organizations have begun to replace legacy native apps with Progressive Web Apps. Take a look at the <a href="http://go.kodakmoments.com/">PWA I helped create for Kodak Alaris</a> so customers could order photo products from their phone. Coffee giant Starbucks has released a new version of their mobile ordering application that has replaced their native application with a PWA. Take a look at the case study by Formidable who did the development. It delves into complex business logic, offline usage, animations, and emphasis on the customer experience (<a href="https://formidable.com/work/starbucks-progressive-web-app/">https://formidable.com/work/starbucks-progressive-web-app/</a>).
